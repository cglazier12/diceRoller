# diceRoller
A dice roller using javascript and jQuery

There is an explanation to the code at the bottom of scripts.js

I use Jquery, you do not have to be familiar with jQuery but do know that $('#dice').click(function() on line 1, and $( "#result" )...
on line 17, is the same thing as saying document.getElementById('idName') with regular js.

This is certainly not the most efficient way to acheive the desired outcome, however it uses a lot of different skills and serves as a decent demo, at least i think so, of a lot of different things you can do with javascript.

This goes over: 
  triggering functions when a button is clicked 
  declaring and assigning js variables to a random number
  storing variables in an array
  sorting an array from highest to lowest
  checking to see the contents of a div with an if conditional
  formating and printing items in an array with an each loop. Note: this for each loop uses jQuery. you can check the MDN for vanilla           syntax of a for each loop
  passing variables in as arguments or parameters
  And last but not least some unintentional modest recursion (a function that class itself within the function.
